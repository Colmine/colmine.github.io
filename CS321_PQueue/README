****************
* Project #2: Priority-Queue
* Class: CS321 Fall2019
* Date: 09/27/2019
* Cole Gilmore
**************** 
OVERVIEW:

Takes in generic object types with an associated key value for the object,
or process, and then orders them within a max heap format. The program will
then simulate a CPU of sorts and remove the processes/objects from the 
queue depending on their priority level and length of time to finish them.


INCLUDED FILES:

 List of files required for the project with a brief
 explanation of why each is included.

 * MaxHeap.java - source file, contains all of the methods for the heap
 	that PQueue uses to sort, insert, and remove from the queue of processes.
 * PQueue.java - source file, leverages the methods from MaxHeap.java to
 	create a priority based queue, with the highest priority being at the front.
 * Process.java - source file, creates Process objects that will be sorted by
 	MaxHeap.java and PQueue.java, and created in ProcessGenerator.java.
 * ProcessGenerator.java - source file, generates random values to assign to
 	a process before adding the process to the queue.
 * README - this file, explains organization and workings within the program
	
(Required Files but NOT Included)
 * CPUScheduler.java - driver class, reads the arguments from the command line
	to actually execute the program.
 * Averager.java - source file, provides methods to CPUScheduler for complete
	functionality of the program.
 * HeapNode.java - source file, node class for MaxHeap.java to allow traversal
	of the heap.
 


COMPILING AND RUNNING:

 From the directory containing all source files, compile the
 driver class (and all dependencies) with the command:
 (NOTE: CPUScheduler.java, Averager.java, and HeapNode.java are not included as they
 	were given to us and we were told not to include them in the submission, but they
 	are vital to try and run the program.)
 
 $ javac MaxHeap.java PQueue.java Process.java ProcessGenerator.java 
 
  OR
 
 $ javac *.java

 
 Run the compiled class file with the command:
 $ java CPUScheduler [integer value for maxProcessTime] 
 			[integer value for maxPriorityLevel] 
 			[integer value for the time until a processes' priority is raised] 
 			[integer value for the length of the simulation] 
 			[double value from 0 to 1]

 Console output will give the results as the program runs and the total statistics
 of the run upon completion.

PROGRAM DESIGN AND IMPORTANT CONCEPTS:

General -
The main organization of the program is to try and contain the majority of the code to
MaxHeap.java, and follow the UML diagram provided to us. This is because the first project, 
for me, was incredibly messy and rushed, so, the main goal for this project was to try and 
keep things more organized and reduce the amount of code duplication. The main algorithm 
for the MaxHeap.java class, and by extension the PQueue.java class, is the maxHeapify() method. 
This method performs almost exactly the same as your standard maxHeapify algorithm. Meaning 
that a value or object is inserted into a heap based structure and it's value is compared 
to the branches below, and the root above its position. After the comparison is finished the 
algorithm determines whether the value needs to be moved up or down within the heap. 

MaxHeap.java -
The majority of MaxHeap.java's methods use the maxHeapify() method to maintain a max heap
within the array. Meaning the maximum value is at the front of the array and the minimum is
at a leaf on one of the branches. The only method that differs from this style is the
second constructor in MaxHeap.java, this is because when using maxHeapify() the program
runs into null pointer errors. Instead, the second constructor uses a while loop to manually
sort and promote objects/processes based on their key values. There are two unused methods
left in the class as they were required in the UML diagram but their purpose was unknown
other than the possibility that some driver class or test class required them.

PQueue.java -
The PQueue.java class is essentially a weaker version of the MaxHeap.java class. It has no
unique methods and simply uses calls to the MaxHeap.java methods. The main reason for this
class is to provided a go-between for CPUScheduler.java, Process.java, and ProcessGenerator.java.

Process.java -
The organization for Process.java was to simply follow the UML diagram provided to us
to keep things fairly neat and linear. This class is essentially just a bunch of getter and
setter methods for creating a Process object. As well as a constructor to create a Process
object for ProcessGenerator.java, which will randomly assign values to the new processes' 
variables. There are also four unused methods in the class as I was unsure of where or how
to use them, these methods were required in the UML diagram so I'd assume they are needed
by the driver class.

ProcessGenerator.java -
For this class the main purpose was to generate random values, such as double and integer values,
for a new Process object. After a new process has been created it will take the randomly
generated process and stick it into the priority queue/heap when called in the main class, 
CPUScheduler.java. Again, the main organization and requirements for this class were laid
out in the UML diagram provided to us. There is a method that remains unused within the class
as I couldn't really think of when or how it should be used other than by an outside class, which
doesn't make much sense as it was required to be a private method.


Conclusion -
The only issues I encountered during the creation of these classes was in the use of the
MaxHeap() constructors. When CPUScheduler is run over a command line there was a very
high chance that you will get an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: Index 0 is out of bounds
for length 0. This was caused by the fact that in CPUScheduler there's an issue in the update() 
method as it effectively calls the MaxHeap(T[] array, int[] array) constructor with 0 and 0, rather
than the default constructor. So, unless you have this odd conditional check to make sure that
someone isn't passing in empty arrays, during the use of CPUScheduler your program will break.

TESTING:

The testing process for this program was to check every method against the tests provided
to us through TestNG before trying to integrate another method. The process was a fairly
standard one, make sure the tests pass for an empty heap, then a small heap, and then a large
heap. After the methods for HeapMax.java were all passing for the test suite it was just a
matter of moving onto the PQueue.java class. Implementing and running the test suite for that
class in the same fashion as MaxHeap.java. After both of those classes were passing all of
the test cases I implemented the Process.java and ProcessGenerator.java classes. Before testing
the program over the command line I made a simple test class to make sure all of the methods in
Process.java and ProcessGenerator.java were working correctly and assigning values with how
I believe they should be.

Once all of the classes were implemented and tested against the test suite I moved over
to Onyx and testing the program with some command line inputs and the provided run_test file.
This is the only area where I believe an issue/bug was ecountered that wasn't due to incorrect
implementation on my part. The program would run and break about 99% of the time. When a process 
got added to the queue it would add the first process just fine, but when it gets to adding in a 
second process it would break. I initially thought this was due to an incorrect array index being 
passed in that was now out of bounds. It turns out this was partially correct, the CPUScheduler
class would call the update() method in CPUScheduler and pass in the values for an empty array. 
This would then create a new MaxHeap with a capacity of 0, essentially an empty heap with no room
for any insertions. To fix this, a conditional check was added to the MaxHeap(T[] array, int[] array)
constructor to check if the arrays passed as parameters were empty or not.

DISCUSSION:

The main issue I encountered during development was getting the maxHeapify() method in
MaxHeap.java to work properly. I spent a good day trying to figure out why objects weren't
being properly sorted when the method was called in other methods and why I was getting
null pointer references. Turns out I had been using the node's .getKey() method rather than
simply comparing the node's .getKey() value at a given index. I had essentially been comparing
a node to another node and then just randomly picking one, rather than picking the correct one
based on its key value. After I got the maxHeapify() method to work not much else turned into a
problem.

The only other issue encountered was in the last stages of testing over Onyx, where the program
would break about 90% of the time throwing an error at the user. I initially believed it to be how 
the default constructor in maxHeap() is setup/interacts with the methods in MaxHeap.java. However, 
after running through the debugger multiple times over the course of a few days I found that the
error was contained in the CPUScheduler's update() method and the second constructor in MaxHeap,
as stated previously, the update() method would pass in 0 for the two parameters, creating a heap
without the ability to add anything without getting an error. To fix this, a conditional check
was needed to make sure that the arrays passed into this constructor weren't empty/0. I still 
believe that this project was a vast improvement over the first project, for me that is. Really, 
I'm just glad that the project works now and was implemented fairly close to what I believe was
asked of us. 


I think that the only thing I would change would be removing the unused methods in a couple of
the classes, or having asked more questions during class time to figure out why these methods
were needed. My assumption on why they were needed was to enforce encapsulation but I don't believe
there should be anyway to break encapsulation as the PQueue class is essentially making a copy of
the MaxHeap and calling its methods on the PQueue instance.
